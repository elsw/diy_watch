# binary_watch

This is a project to create a homecrew binary watch to fit inside a analogue wrist watch

## issues

- No Vcc out of the LTC4071 chip, swapped LBSEL to set the `Low Battery Connect` to 3.6V but never get any voltage out. Change to MCP73833? also cheaper. [reference curcuit](https://learn.adafruit.com/li-ion-and-lipoly-batteries/downloads)
- Cannot debug RP2040 code, got it working once but not again, I think it's something up with the cdoe itself, debugging reliable blink code though... (change to pico 2??) (try embassy???)

## Components
```
Raspberry Pi RP2040 Microchip
LIR2032 40mAH button Battery
```

## Example Project

## Display Ideas

### binary LEDs

Needs a 400mah lipo to last around 25 hours always on

### EInk screen 

[Watch eink](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005791100921.html) no docs
Would fit maybe

Too LONG

Should last about a week refreshing every minute using the 40mah battery i think
